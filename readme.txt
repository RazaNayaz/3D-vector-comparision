The console application is required to perform the following tasks in order:
1.	Take user input of username and password from the user and compare (login). 
2.	Compare two 3D vectors.
3.	Calculate the azimuth of a 3D vector.
We used an interface for the user to interact with the application. The application created can perform the above tasks successfully and works without any error.
